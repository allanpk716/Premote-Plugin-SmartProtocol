This is a plug-in use by [PRemote](https://github.com/VShawn/PRemoteM) . It will be adjusted according to the use.

Support Protocol. see [go-protocol-detector](https://github.com/allanpk716/go-protocol-detector):

* RDP
* FTP
* SFTP
* SSH
* VNC
* Telnet

## Why

In some cases, [PRemote](https://github.com/VShawn/PRemoteM) need create a lot of server connection items. like:

![00](readmeThings/pics/00.png)

This is just two servers,  but your may connect it in LAN, or mapping to local host by  [FRP](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) , like：

![01](readmeThings/pics/01.png)

so [Premote-Plugin-SmartProtocol](https://github.com/allanpk716/Premote-Plugin-SmartProtocol) can give you another options.

## How To Use

### Work with PRemote

if you have a server, it can be connected by 2 ways：

| IP:Port             | Connection Type   | Protocol |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| 127.0.0.1:53391     | FRP to local host | RDP      |
| 192.168.50.188:3389 | LAN               | RDP      |

1. Download [PRemote Test Version - branch - dev_SmartProtocol](https://github.com/allanpk716/PRemoteM/tree/dev_SmartProtocol)，at this time, you need build by yourself. (later....  after talk with the author , you can download zip. uzip to your localtion)；

2. download this plug-in, from  [Release](https://github.com/allanpk716/Premote-Plugin-SmartProtocol/releases) , Premote-Plugin-SmartProtocol.zip ( also you can build it all by yourself )；

3. uzip 2 files to PRemote folder ( Premote-Plugin-SmartProtocol.exe、SPConfig.yaml );

4. edit SPConfig.yaml file

   ```yaml
   SPConfigs:
     Code:
       ProtocolName: RDP
       TimeOut: 1000 # ms
       MultiAddress:
         - 127.0.0.1:53391
         - 192.168.50.188:3389
   ```

    ProtocolName can be ( Case matters ):

    * RDP
    * FTP
    * SFTP
    * SSH
    * VNC
    * Telnet

5. create a server connection item in [PRemote](https://github.com/VShawn/PRemoteM) , like：

   ![02](readmeThings/pics/02.png)

   The important thing is **Address**，must be **SP://** , so fill your user name and password .

6. So you can call  **Code_SP**  by PRemote ；

### Work in CMD

Input

```powershell
.\Premote-Plugin-SmartProtocol.exe RDP SP://Code
```

Output

```powershell
IP:Port
```

## How To Work

PRemote will send the address( **SP://**  ) to PPSP(Premote-Plugin-SmartProtocol) , then PPSP will reply "IP:Port" which define in SPConfig.yaml.

## How To Build

```bash
go build
```

## Upate

* v0.2.0 -- A new setup interface **UseCommonportCheck** allows you to use the usual port detection scheme to determine if it is valid. Because the specific protocol is not detected, if there is a local proxy port, the feedback will be faster than the LAN. It is recommended that you manually enable temporary use when the tool detects a problem with some version of some protocol. Not recommended opening (set **true**) by default.

## TODO

Improve usability with [PRemote](https://github.com/VShawn/PRemoteM) .
